Being WIP, this mod needs no readme just yet. I will fill this out more as the mod grows, however I am expecting a lot of big changes. All you need to know for now is that, in the state it's currently in, you simply need 9 wool to craft the RGB wool required to colour your world. Fill the crafting table with white wool and surround your new craft with whatever dyes your heart desires!
